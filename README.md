## Overview

### The challenge

The main goal of this challenge is to build out the project to the designs provided by practicing flexbox skills.

## My process

To build this project without Sketch and Figma design file access, I used the LightShot application to take screenshots and analyze the desired content in parts. You can check this analysis in the image below:

This was the first solution's version:

In this solution is possible to see any background image in body or in the personal informations section. So as we can see a spacing flexbox issue in account information, where the LI elements are closer than the original design.

Now, let's have a look in the second's solution:

 That solution is only possible thanks to Frontend Mentor community, who answered my doubts and helped me to build a better code. A special thanks to [Hugo Sanchez](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/HunigoleSan) and [Daniel](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/danielmrz-dev).

 The screenshot comes directly from my local server, when I uploaded this new version to GitHub, I find the following issue on GitHub Pages:
![New issue](./design/404-issue.png)
All of my bg-pattern-top.svg, bg-pattern-bottom.svg, and bg-pattern-card.svg images have the 404 Not Found status code,  just as if they were missing files.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- CSS variables;
- Flexbox.

### What I learned

It was a relevant project for reinforcing semantic HTML skills, styling and my first flexbox practice where I was able to reinforce the content learned in the classes and activities of the DevQuest course. Building the first project alone is a good experience as it tested what I have really learned and what topics I need to revisit.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for being a visual resource and bring some pratical examples of application. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [My own class notes (pt-BR)](https://www.notion.so/CSS-Avan-ado-Flexbox-046260bf28e64e89a553623ba180ea03?pvs=4) -These notes were made in class, during explanations of concepts and practical examples.
