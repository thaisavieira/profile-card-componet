## Overview

### The challenge

The main goal of this challenge is to build out the project to the designs provided practicing flexbox skills.

## My process

To build this project without Sketch and Figma design file access, I used the LightShot application to take screenshots and analyze the desired content in parts. You can check this analysis in the image below:
![Screenshot analysis](./design/Screenshot_1.png)
Although I reached a similar result, something that bothers me is the little spacing between the elements of the .account-info class:
![Screenshot analysis](./design/Screenshot_2.png)
What did I do:
What I have already tested is that the justify-content property has the same result when I apply the space-around and space-evenly values, while space-between the element in question sticks to the corner. When I remove the padding:30px, the result is that the element rises by 30px and does not result in changes to the sides.

Follow the code below

```CSS
.card .account-info li{
    display: inline-block;
}

.card .account-info{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 30px;
}
```

If possible, I would like tips on how I can solve this problem to make the solution more similar to the proposed design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- CSS variables;
- Flexbox.

### What I learned

It was a relevant project for reinforcing semantic HTML skills, styling and my first flexbox practice where I was able to reinforce the content learned in the classes and activities of the DevQuest course. Building the first project alone is a good experience as it tested what I have really learned and what topics I need to revisit.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for being a visual resource and bring some pratical examples of application. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [My own class notes (pt-BR)](https://www.notion.so/CSS-Avan-ado-Flexbox-046260bf28e64e89a553623ba180ea03?pvs=4) -These notes were made in class, during explanations of concepts and practical examples.
